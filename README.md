# WeatherApp
A web application designed with help of HTML,CSS and JavaScript to fetch weather details.

I have used Open Weather Map API URL and API key to fetch weather details.
And created an interactive design for this application.
For getting results we have to enter city details in search box and click on search button to find weather details.
This application shows temperature in celcius , humidity and wind spped.
And major part is that weather icon changes according to weather details.
